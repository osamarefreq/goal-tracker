- its have static 12 goals to start with and you can edit them only
- the app is responsive
- add your money target and compare it in the last of the month
- all save in local storage so you can close the browser and come back to it later

## How to use

- you can add your own goals by clicking on the on any white space in the goals section (the white box)
- the reason i didnt make it dynamic is because i want to make it simple and easy to use because if i make it dynamic it will be hard to use and it will be hard to track the progress  + you will have alot of goals to track and you will get confused
- you can change anything in the page and it will be saved in local storage so you can close the browser and come back to it later
